Only commits with tag "release" will be used to generate a new release.
To commit a release version follow these steps:

1. Create a local commit 
2. Remove tag "release" with checkbox "Remove tag from all remotes"
3. Insert a new tag "release" in the last commit WITHOUT the checkbox "Push tag:"
4. Push with checkbox "Push all tags"
